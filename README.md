# âš½ Football Outcome Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the outcome of football matches (win / draw / loss) using historical team statistics and match data.  
This example uses **Manchester City 2023â€“2024 season stats**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
The project builds a predictive model to forecast match outcomes based on:
- Team performance statistics (goals, shots, possession, etc.)
- Recent form and results
- Historical match data

It demonstrates **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning classification** using Python.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression / Random Forest (classification)
- **Data:** JSON stats file (`man_city_2023_2024_stats.json`)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Work Done
- Loaded and processed raw football match data from JSON.
- Engineered features (win/loss flags, goal differences, average stats).
- Trained classification models to predict match outcomes.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores.
- Created a reusable script for future datasets (`football_outcome_prediction.py`).

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/football-outcome-prediction.git
cd football-outcome-prediction

# (Optional) create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt   # or manually: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

# Run prediction
python main.py
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ File Structure
```
football_outcome_prediction.py   # Core ML logic (training & prediction)
main.py                          # Entry point to run predictions
scoresjson.py                    # Loads the stats JSON
man_city_2023_2024_stats.json    # Example dataset
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Next Steps
- Expand dataset to multiple leagues & seasons.
- Experiment with advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM).
- Deploy as a web app (Streamlit/FastAPI) for interactive predictions.
